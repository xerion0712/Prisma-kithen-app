## 🚀 Introduction

A monorepo containing:

- Next.js web app
- React Native app with Expo
- [Prisma](http://prisma.io/) as a typesafe ORM

> In tRPC you simply write API-functions that are automatically inferred straight into your frontend - no matter if it's React, React Native, or something else _(that is TS/JS-based)_.
